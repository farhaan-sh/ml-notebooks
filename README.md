# Basics of Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks and code examples for learning the basics of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms are the methods or rules that guide the learning process.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**.

- **Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, which means the data has a known output or target variable. The goal of supervised learning is to find a function that maps the input data to the output data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms are **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, **decision tree**, **support vector machine**, **k-nearest neighbors**, **neural network**, etc.
- **Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, which means the data has no known output or target variable. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns or structure in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are **clustering**, **dimensionality reduction**, **association rule mining**, **anomaly detection**, etc.

In this repository, you will find notebooks that explain and demonstrate some of the most common and popular machine learning algorithms. You will also learn how to use Python libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, etc. to implement and evaluate these algorithms.
