    "**Problem Statement: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "In the real estate market, accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers. As a data scientist, your task is to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "You will use the California Housing dataset, which is publicly available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average occupation, and geographical information like latitude and longitude. The target variable is the median house value for California districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Build a linear regression model to predict the median house value for districts in California based on the provided features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Take:**\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Load the California Housing dataset.\n",
    "   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Handle missing values if any.\n",
    "   - Perform feature scaling if necessary.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development:**\n",
    "   - Implement a linear regression model using appropriate libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).\n",
    "   - Train the model on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.\n",
    "   - Analyze the residuals to understand the model's shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "   - Explore opportunities for feature engineering if needed.\n",
    "   - Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Results and Conclusion:**\n",
    "   - Summarize the findings, including the model's predictive ability and any insights gained.\n",
    "   - Discuss potential use cases and limitations of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.\n",
    "2. Visualization of the model's predictions vs. actual values.\n",
    "3. A brief report summarizing the project, methodology, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem statement provides a structured approach for practicing linear regression on a real-world dataset, allowing you to enhance your skills in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation."
